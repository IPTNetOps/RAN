This project help us to improve BCCH  channels using CellBroadcast (BCCH_CBCCH) and for SMS (MBCCH) services, mainly.
At the beginning we had both of them using the same TRX (Combined BCCH);
however, the SMS services had been experienced long delays to arrive to final user (more than 60 sec),
but after splitting them we had a much better performance getting less than 20 sec that takes the sms to arrive to final user.
